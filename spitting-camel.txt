Spitting Camel is a game engine, written in OCaml, for 2D games.  It
uses SDL and OpenGL.

There is a lot of functionality it doesn't include...  At least some of this
is because it is included in the underlying SDL or OpenGL libraries, and there
is no meaningful functionality I can add to it.
Example: Functions to do funky things to sound and music are not included,
because they would essentially just be meaningless wrappers around the
OCamlSDL library functions that do the same things.


XXX: We should do screenworld-vs-gameworld translation at some point!
--> OpenGL handles this.

XXX: Particles?

XXX: Billboards!
