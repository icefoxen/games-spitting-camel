To do now:
OH GODS FIXED RATE PHYSICS CODE PLUS INTERPOLATION
HOW THE FUCK DO I MAKE THAT HAPPEN?!?!

let calcumalate things now = 
   List.map (fun obj -> let newobj = obj#calc now in
      (newobj, obj)) things 
and draw things now = 
   List.iter (fun (new,old) -> new#drawWithInterpolation old now) things
;;

Like that.

Better error handling everywhere.
Document!


Improvements:
 * input.ml: Mouse drag
 * anim.ml: Figure out what you want to actually do, make it function-y, 
test it.
 * Add prefixes to all the module names.
